Good Psychology

## to-do
- rework index page (under `temp.html` until ready to launch)
- create contact page (with email form?)
- create resources index (for FAQ material)
- improve staff pages (with headshot etc)
- think about CTA text in buttons / titles
- consider changing `<section id="title">` to `h1`

when ready to launch:
- add `sitemap: true` to pages
- rename `temp.html` to `index.html`
- add sitemap to `robots.txt`
- submit sitemap to google & check for errors: https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/sitemaps/build-sitemap
