        <h2>Meet the team</h2>
        <p>Stephen and Bilal are psychologists who are passionate about bringing psychoanalysis in its most radical and soulful forms to Australian patients. They met while teaching at The Australian National University.</p>
        <div id="bios">
            <div>
                <h2>Stephen</h2>
                <span>CBD, Canberra</span>
                <p>Stephen is a Canberra-born psychologist with an innate optimism for people and the potential of psychological therapy, grounded in depth of expertise and experience. He has a PhD (Clinical Psychology) and a Master of Laws (Legal Practice).</p>
                <p>Besides his psychology practice, Stephen has worked for over a decade in senior roles in the public, private and community sectors as a policy advisor, lawyer, researcher, consultant and academic.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2>Bilal</h2>
                <span>Brunswick, Melbourne</span>
                <p>Bilal is a Melbourne-based psychologist with a curiosity for people and their patterning. His practice combines ‘applied philosophy’ and the play and poetics between two strangers in service of healing.</p>
                <p>He ‘specialises’ in people, not labels. Whether it is navigating ADHD, giftedness, trauma, attachment issues, treatment-resistant depression, or burnout, the focus is always on the person behind the ‘problem’.</p>

        Psychotherapy is the art of un/becoming, not the science of symptoms.

    <section id="about">
        <h2>Our approach</h2>
        <p>Therapy often focuses on the short-term management of symptoms using manualised therapies. Our practice is rooted in an older but constantly evolving tradition, appreciating the art and science of psychotherapy. We believe in the value of in-depth, long-term exploration for lasting change.</p>
        <p>We are a boutique alliance. At any one time we see a small number of patients, so that we can give you our full attention. While we are trained in CBT, ACT, EFS, IFS, these are but a small part of our repertoire. We are interested in long-term depth work.</p>
        <p>Behind any diagnosis is a person with subjectivity, stories, dreams, and gifts. People are in a process of continuous unfolding, and we are interested in understanding how the genetic and spiritual mosaic of each person can and has been disrupted. By attending to the faultlines in therapy, we hope patients can become free of walls and reclaim their sense of self in the world.</p>

    <section id="faq">
        <h3>Do I need psychotherapy?</h3>
        <p>We believe there are many paths to healing. Psychotherapy is a beautiful one.</p>

        <h3>How can I know if Good Psychology is right for me?</h3>
        <p>We can’t tell you. While we are confident in our abilities, part of that means knowing that not every therapist is for everyone. We suggest you read our website and follow your intuition.</p>

        <h3>How long does therapy take?</h3>
        <p>Our work lends itself to longer-term therapies. A typical path consists of 10–20 once- or twice-weekly appointments, followed by another 10–20 weekly/fortnightly appointments.</p>
        <p>We understand people want to see change. We believe enduring change takes time. Although we are open to shorter-term work, if that’s something you are seeking, we recommend you first visit a solution-/strategy-focused counsellor or psychologist.</p>

        <h3>What are the fees?</h3>
        <p>Stephen sees patients for 50 minutes and offers fees on a sliding scale. Bilal charges $280 per 80-minute session. We both offer Medicare rebates and a limited number of concession places.</p>

        <h3>Is there a waitlist?</h3>
        <p>Bilal and Stephen are both taking on new patients in <span id="upcoming-month-text"></span>.</p>

        <h3>Do I need a referral?</h3>
        <p>You do not need a referral to see a psychologist. However, if you wish to receive Medicare rebates, you will need a Mental Health Treatment Plan prepared by a GP. They must provide a letter with the date of referral, their name, signature and Medicare Provider Number; your name, date of birth and address; a request for services under Better Access; and a number of sessions (e.g. 6 or 10).</p>
