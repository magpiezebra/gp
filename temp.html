        <h2>Meet the team</h2>
        <p>Bilal, Danu, and Stephen are psychologists who are passionate about psychoanalytic psychotherapy in its most radical and soulful forms. They met while teaching at The Australian National University.</p>
        <div id="bios">

                <h3>Danu</h3>
                <span>East Melbourne, Melbourne</span>
                <p>Danu is a Melbourne-based psychologist who believes therapy is a paradox of acceptance and challenge. It is a puzzle to be solved with patients who have some psychic or social injury and are looking for someone to help them accept both who they are, and who they can be. Danu has a PhD (Clinical Psychology) and was a lecturer and a clinician in the justice system.</p>

                <span>Brunswick, Melbourne</span>
                <p>Bilal is a Melbourne-based psychologist with a curiosity for people and their patterning. He sees therapy as the play and poetics between two strangers in service of healing.</p>

            <div>
                <h3>Stephen</h3>
                <span>CBD, Canberra</span>
                <p>Stephen is a Canberra-born psychologist with an innate optimism for people and the potential of psychological therapy. He has a PhD (Clinical Psychology) and a Master of Laws (Legal Practice). Stephen has also worked for over a decade in senior roles in the public, private and community sectors as a policy advisor, lawyer, researcher, consultant and academic.</p>

    <section id="about">
        <h2>Our approach</h2>
        <p>Therapy often focuses on the short-term management of symptoms using manualised therapies. Our practice is rooted in a different tradition, appreciating the art and science of psychotherapy. We believe in the value of in-depth, long-term exploration for lasting change.</p>
        <p>We are a boutique alliance. At any one time we only see a small number of patients, so we can give you our full attention. While we are trained in CBT, ACT, EFS and IFS, these are but a sliver of our repertoire. We are interested in long-term depth work.</p>
        <p>Behind any diagnosis is a person with subjectivity, stories, dreams, and gifts. People are continually unfolding. We are interested in understanding how each person’s genetic and spiritual mosaic can and has been disrupted. By attending to these faultlines, we hope to free patients of walls and allow them to reclaim their sense of self in the world.</p>

    <section id="faq">
        <h4>Do I need psychotherapy?</h4>
        <p>We believe there are many paths to healing. Psychotherapy is a beautiful one.</p>

        <h4>How can I know if Good Psychology is right for me?</h4>
        <p>We can’t tell you. We are confident in our abilities, but part of that means knowing that no one therapist is for everyone. Follow your intuition based on what we’ve written here.</p>
        <p>Bring your fears, hopes and questions to your initial session and we can create an individualised therapy journey with you.</p>

        <h4>How long does therapy take?</h4>
        <p>Our work lends itself to longer-term therapies. A typical path consists of 10–20 weekly or twice-weekly appointments, followed by another 10–20 weekly or fortnightly appointments.</p>
        <p>We understand people want to see change, but enduring change often takes time. Although we are open to shorter-term work, if that’s something you seek, we recommend that you first visit a solution-/strategy-focused counsellor or psychologist.</p>

        <h4>What are the fees?</h4>
        <p>Bilal, Danu, and Stephen see patients for 50–80 minutes and offer fees on a sliding scale. We offer Medicare rebates and a limited number of concession places.</p>

        <h4>Is there a waitlist?</h4>
        <p>Bilal, Danu, and Stephen are taking on new patients<span id="upcoming-month-text"></span>.</p>

        <h4>Do I need a referral?</h4>
        <p>You do not need a referral to see a psychologist. However, if you wish to receive Medicare rebates, you will need a Mental Health Treatment Plan prepared by a GP. They must provide a letter with the date of referral, their name, signature and Medicare Provider Number; your name, date of birth and address; a request for services under Better Access; and a number of sessions (e.g. 6 or 10).</p>
